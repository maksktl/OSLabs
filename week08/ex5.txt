if we are talking about RAM, then physical is the address of a specific memory cell on page zero
 (if RAM is divided into pages and blocks) . 
Virtual address - the address of the memory cell in the virtual
 memory page. The latter is determined by the resources of the OS itself and the features of
 the memory management hardware. It can be located outside of the physical RAM.

example:
Physical address: Pushkin street, the house 14, room 7
Virtual address: university.innopolis.ru
